1. Copy files dependencies (those in 'bWave_deps') from cloned projects directly, where the files were taken from.
2. Port toZigbee.js file properly. Currently it is ported manually - only that little part
that is used, and copied to destination folder.
3. Fix files and folders structure - configs to one folder, scripts to another, etc
